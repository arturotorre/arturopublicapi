Website created to use an external and public API.

Maybe you're wondering how you can put this website to work in your computer (Too obvious, that's why you're here), well don't worry! Below you can see the instructions to set it up in your computer :)

Requirements:
- Javascript
- Nodejs
- EJS

1st Step: Downlad all the files in this repository and save them in a folder that is easy for you to access.

2nd Step: Open index.js in your IDE (VS CODE preferably), open a new terminal inside of it and run the command npm i to install all the dependencies that are inside this project.

3rd Step: Once all the dependencies are installed, run command "nodemon index.js" in your terminal.

4rd Step: Head to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to start enjoying your jokes!

This is my very first project, you may see big areas of improvement and the goal is to attack them as soon as I get better in my programming skills.

Thank you for being here!
